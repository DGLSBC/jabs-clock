# jabs-clock
Just A Basic SVG Clock

A fork and much enhanced replacement for cairo-clock, an analog desktop clock
  drawn with SVG and cairo and gtk 2.0

----
This is my first GNU/Linux project. I've been messing with it since May 2015.
It seems to run fine on the distros I've tested it on, which are several of the
popular newer ones. It's been tested most on Linux Mint/XFCE Rebecca.

There's a complete 'starter' app home directory in home/.jabs-clock, including
pre-built gtk2 and gtk3 executables if you don't feel like building from source.

Please see the readme files in each directory for specifics, including the
current set of dependencies for running and building from source.

Still very much a beta since I'm the only one who's tested it, but hopefully
it'll work for you.
