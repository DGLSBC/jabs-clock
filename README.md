# jabs-clock
Just A Basic SVG Clock

A fork and much enhanced replacement for cairo-clock

----
This is my first GNU/Linux project. I've been messing with it since May 2015.
It seems to run fine on the distros I've tested it on, which are several of the
newer ones. It runs best on Mint/XFCE, as no startup wait time is required to
get it to display a properly scaled clock.

Still very much a beta but hopefully it will work for you.

Please see the readme file for specifics.
