# jabs-clock
Just A Basic SVG Clock

A fork and much enhanced replacement for cairo-clock, an analog desktop clock
  drawn with SVG and cairo and gtk 2.0

----
This is my first GNU/Linux project. I've been messing with it since May 2015.
It seems to run fine on the distros I've tested it on, which are several of the
newer ones. It runs best on Mint/XFCE, as no startup wait time is required to
get it to display a properly scaled clock.

Still very much a beta but hopefully it will work for you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a fork of the Launchpad cairo-clock code found at
  https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/cairo-clock.

I *think* all of the non-install related bugs listed there have been squashed,
  but there's still lots of testing to be done.

Currently under heavy development with no distribution or build niceties added
  yet. Just an 'install' script to pull down the needed shared libraries
  (very minimal: apt-get use only) and a make file for creating the executable.

There are 32 bit x86 targeted executables in the home/.jabs-clock directory, as
  well as a starting cfg file, gui cfg files, some sound files, and some new
  themes I created by combining cairo-clock's 12 and 24 hour themes together.

This is my first GNU/Linux project so I'd like to publicly thank Mirco for
  making cairo-clock and for making it open source. It's been fun learning
  gdk/gtk, cairo, svg, etc., using his code as a starting point.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Current feature list beyond that of cairo-clock 0.3.4 includes (but is not
  limited to):

- drag-n-drop support for simple theme archives

- shouldn't crash for themes that have missing clock element svgs

- shouldn't crash for missing themes and/or glade gui directories or files
  (a <simple> theme internal to the clock is used when necessary)

- much reduced cpu usage regardless of theme complexity or clock size,
  typically 3 to 5 times less or more

- if cairo-dock is running, will use dbus to send current time based icon
  and label display requests every minute

- when not visible on the current workspace, the app doesn't re-draw itself
  (currently not enabled by default)

- creates current theme-based icons for window manager taskbar/pager use

- theme name lists are now sorted, and done so in a 'natural sort' way
  (case insensitive, theme10 follows theme1, etc.)

- rudimentary checks are made on a theme directories sub-directories contents
  to try and ensure they contain a valid theme

- for those themes containing both 12 and 24-hour clock-marks svgs, changing
  the '24-hour display' setting will automatically switch between them without
  requiring the selection of a different theme

- the standard themes that had 12 and 24-hour versions (default, gremlin,
  ipulse, radium, silvia, and simple) have been combined into 'theme-new'
  versions that all contain both 12 and 24-hour clock-marks svgs

- mouse wheel support for the following:
  - theme changing (using ctrl)
  - size changing (using shift or nothing)
  - date text size changing (using alt)

- mouse middle button resizing was changed to allow resizing based upon
  the clock quadrant the mouse cursor is within; also, resizing with the
  shift key down constrains the resizing to a square

- resizing and theme changing currently occur via secondary worker threads,
  so even complicated themes should not halt the clock hand animation while
  all of the new versions of the required resources are being created (resizing
  still has some wonkiness to it that needs to be fixed but the end result is
  correct)

- key support for the following:
  - ESC or q or Q to stop the clock app
  - context menu to bring up the right-click (context) menu
  - 2 or 4 to toggle 12-hour/24-hour display
  - b or B to toggle taskbar display
  - c or C to center the clock on the display
  - d or D to toggle date text display
  - f or F to change the date text layer
  - i or I to toggle workspace stickiness
  - k or K to toggle click-thru ability
  - m or M to toggle maximum size display
  - o or O to toggle staying above other windows
  - p or P to toggle pager display
  - r or R to reduce/increase animation redraw rate
  - s or S to toggle second hands display
  - t or T for a text only display
  - ?

- gui support for the following:
  - keeping the clock below all other windows
  - specifying the layer the date text is shown on
  - starting the clock with an animated 'zooming' effect
  - specifying the screen corner to which the x and y coordinates are relative
  - ?

- command line support for the following:
  (run the app with -? to see the complete list)
  - those given above for gui support
  - starting the clock at maximum size
  - specifying a startup delay time to ensure the compositor is running
  - specifying the use of the user's configuration settings as a default
  - specifying the workspace the clock is shown on
  - specifying the clock as being click-thru'able'
  - specifying the clock display opacity
  - ?

- config entry support for the following:
  - those given above for cli support
  - displaying (or not) of any of the clock hands
  - specifying the playing of any alarm or quarter-hour chime sounds
  - specifying the second hand animation method: original, flick, or sweep
  - specifying the date text font face, font size, color, and format
  - specifying the color and outline width of the date text's shadow
  - specifying the 'from center' vertical offset of the date text
  - specifying the tooltip text date and time text 12 hour format
  - specifying the tooltip text date and time text 24 hour format
  - specifying the window title date and time text format

- rudimentary support, using hardcoded-only test values for the following:
  - paths to the quarter hour chime sound files
  - path to the alarm sound file
  - ?
