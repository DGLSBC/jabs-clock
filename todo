Just A Basic SVG Clock - todo

----

In no particular order, here is a list of the 'things' currently being actively
worked on. So this is probably more of a work-in-progress list than a todo list.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- known bugs
  o glade gui won't pass focus around
  o clock not showing on Mate if initial opacity is anything < than 0.99999998
    (this is a known compiz bug (I think) with a fix that needs to be applied)
  o non-composite mode's background for translucent clock areas is not reset
    on clock moves and resizings (during and after)
  o ?

- known annoyances
  o non-composite mode's clock outline shaping is 'blocky' for 'large' clocks
  o Mint Cinnamon and Mate clock blinks some when changing hand animation curve
  o non-square clock causes hands to be unaligned with tic marks and second hand
    to be too long (possibly clipped) when rotating along the short-axis edges
  o second hand animation momentarily stops on any glade related use on slower
    boxes (like mine), even after use and even for simple uses like popup menus
  o resizing with a click 'near' the center should use center relative sizing,
    i.e., the clock should expand/contract in radius rather than via a given
    set of edges, but it currently does nothing other than change the cursor
  o ?

- feature requests
  o get alarm use fully integrated into the app
  o get time zone use fully integrated into the app
  o need user-specified 12/24 formatting for all date/time related strings
  o ?

- code changes
  o off-load all drawing to worker thread so slow glade gui loading/use doesn't
    momentarily stop clock animation (most noticeable on slower boxes like mine)
  o off-load drawing as well to make animation more precise and especially to
    allow for non-linear redrawing time events to more accurately represent
    hand animation curve changes, especially 'quick' directional changes
  o need a better hand animation interpolation algorithm (than linear)
    when gsl is not available (static simple light-weight cspline?)
  o default alarm hand to a greyscale version of the hour hand
  o get non-composite mode working as well as possible
  o there's a number of known small annoyances to fix
  o get sound use fully integrated into the app
  o replace system call with libnotify use
    (.so loaded ala canberra/etc. use)
  o finish configuration
  o finish settings gui
  o ?

- distro
  o configure script
  o install script
  o ?
